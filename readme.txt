NOTES
===================================

    I know that the pdf says to name the file "paths.cpp" all lowercase...
    Because I am using Java, it follows the standard Java naming convention
    where all classes start with an uppercase first letter.

    I used JavaDocs instead of Doxygen because it is specifically for Java.

    I rewrote my own Matrix.java class that implements only the functions of
    Matrix.cpp needed for this project.
